## How does Themeblr's test suite work?

Themeblr uses [QUnit](http://api.qunitjs.com/), a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit test framework. Each plugin has a file dedicated to its tests in `unit/<plugin-name>.js`.

* `unit/` contains the unit test files for each Themeblr plugin.
* `vendor/` contains third-party testing-related code (QUnit and jQuery).
* `visual/` contains "visual" tests which are run interactively in real browsers and require manual verification by humans.

To run the unit test suite via [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), run `grunt test-js`.

To run the unit test suite via a real web browser, open `index.html` in the browser.


## How do I add a new unit test?

1. Locate and open the file dedicated to the plugin which you need to add tests to (`unit/<plugin-name>.js`).
2. Review the [QUnit API Documentation](http://api.qunitjs.com/) and use the existing tests as references for how to structure your new tests.
3. Write the necessary unit test(s) for the new or revised functionality.
4. Run `grunt test-js` to see the results of your newly-added test(s).

**Note:** Your new unit tests should fail before your changes are applied to the plugin, and should pass after your changes are applied to the plugin.
