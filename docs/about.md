Learn more about this styleguide, particularly how it’s built and who maintains it.

## What and why

Brimer is a CSS Framework built after [Primer](http://primercss.io), GitHub’s internal CSS framework. The idea is to have a cake and eat it too by combining Github attractive clean style and Bootstrap extensive feature list.

## Browser support

Brimer currently supports all the stuff Bootstrap supports

## Future updates

There will be a roadmap that outlines what's comming for future versions of Brimer, promise.

## Dependencies

- Bootstrap, obviously.
- Styles are built with SCSS.
- NPM is used to link with Bootstrap SCSS.
- Bower is used to link GitHub assets, namely our Octicons icon font and Markdown styles.

## Who

Currently maintained by [@websemantics](https://github.com/websemantics), and Web Semantics, Inc, CSS team.
