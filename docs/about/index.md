  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Learn more about this styleguide, particularly how it’s built and who maintains it.</p>

  <h2>What and why</h2>

  <p>Primer is GitHub’s internal CSS framework. It includes basic global styling for typography, small components like buttons and tabs, and our general guidelines for writing HTML and CSS. It’s been used internally at GitHub for years now.</p>

  <p>Open-sourcing Primer means sharing and learning with the community. There’s a lot we can improve upon in Primer, and help is always appreciated. While we don’t currently plan on building this out as a competitor to other front-end frameworks, we will occasionally add, remove, or modify things.</p>

  <h2>Browser support</h2>

  <p>Primer currently supports Internet Explorer 9+ and the latest two versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on OS X and Windows. While not a responsive or mobile-focused project, Mobile Safari and Chrome for Android should render just fine. Support for Linux-based browsers is not strictly guaranteed, but accounted for whenever possible.</p>

  <h2>Future updates</h2>

  <p>See the roadmap for a rough outline on what’s slated for future versions of Primer.</p>
